# ESTIMATION-OF-SCOUR-DOWNSTREAM-OF-A-SKI--JUMP-BUCKET
MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT TO ESTIMATE SCOUR DOWNSTREAM OF A SKI- JUMP BUCKET
Study and estimation of scour downstream of ski jump bucket by taking into account the various factors integral to estimation of depth, length and width of scour hole. 

To analyse data using various linear regression algorithms, decision tree and other tree algorithms and compare results based on RMSE, R-squared and PCC values.

To observe if comparable or better results can be obtained using less number of input parameters than are achieved by M5 model.

Compare the findings against the findings in the following paper:
